This document represents a high-level outline for the Internet of Education (IoE) DAO Framework based on research and community guidance. Each section represents an opportunity for productive feedback and suggestions. Additionally, we welcome meta-feedback on sections that are missing and/or should be excluded. The intention is to incorporate all thoughts from the community and publish the official IoE DAO framework as the backbone for launching the IoE DAO, a global public good and ethical governance blueprint. This document will come to represent the one-stop-shop for understanding three key aspects of the IoE DAO: 1) its reason for existence, 2) its governance model, and 3) its practical operations.

1. **Overview**: An overview of the purpose of the IoE DAO, the high-level edges and contours of its governance design, and its operational strategies. This section functions as a roadmap to the paper, and a background on the IoE network, its contributors, and the global appetite and urgency for an IoE DAO.

2. **Raison d'être**:

   1. Mission & Foundational Beliefs: a description of the IoE’s_Transcendental Goal_to accelerate the world towards 22nd century education technologies. This will include a conversation around the cycle of research informing development, as well as a principled commitment to radical accessibility and ensuring diverse representation when it comes to governance and agenda setting.

   2. Unifying Values: an overview of each of the underlying IoE Network principles:

      1. One open internet; one open IOE
      2. Distributed governance
      3. Effective collaboration
      4. Open standards
      5. Open participation
      6. Proportional influence
      7. Diversity, equity, & inclusion
      8. Data dignity
      9. Agency & access control
      10. Lifelong learning

   3. Mandates: an overview of the three specific, precise mandates to align daily governance with the mission and unifying values discussed above. For example, this section will unpack the following mandates:

      1. Protocols:

         1. Resolve daily issues on forums & channels,
         2. drive weekly meeting agendas,
         3. and develop implementations of open source, interoperable protocols.

      2. Research:

         1. Ask questions and formulate research hypotheses,
         2. Shared, peer reviewed knowledge curation,
         3. and encourage open, organic experimentation.

      3. Advocacy:

         1. Amplify community voices, critiques, and suggestions,
         2. empower a sense of mastery, autonomy, and purpose,
         3. and vigorously advocate for learners and employees rights, needs, and desires.

3. **Governance Framework**

   1. Design Theory: a theory-dense section explaining the rationale and underpinnings of our governance approach, definitions of our key parameters and building blocks, and important first-order considerations before launching: our pathway to decentralization, the metrics we will judge our success by, our attack surface and resistance, and current legal considerations. This will include a conversation and analysis of MVPR, and the ways the IoE DAO is an extension of the traditions and models pioneered by DEVxDAO.

      1. Methodology & Approach: this section will present the challenges of designing and launching a DAO and the ways we, as researchers and practitioners, are choosing to approach the problem. This will include discussion and analysis of theoretical justifications and real-world case studies.
      2. Parameters: definitions of our core governance building blocks and justifications for particular arrangements and implementations. Specifically, this section will discuss merit identifiers, non-fungibility of reputation tokens, degrees of transparency, community audits, indirect economic incentives, staging reputation to vote, salary tokens, and degrees of anonymity, among others.
      3. Path to Decentralization: a description of both our practical and aspirational strategy towards decentralization. Specifically, a description of our founding DAO members, the process and justification for founding DAO members, and analysis of the proper number and variety of initial members—with specific attention given to how the initial composition creates varying and unique challenges in our path to decentralization. Additionally, this section will discuss legitimate strategies for promoting adoption, precedence, and longevity. This section will close with thoughts on cultivating community with specific attention to maintaining engagement, weeding out noise, and encouraging thoughtfulness.
      4. Metrics & KPIs: an enumeration of quantifiable metrics and verifiable performance indicators for us, as a community, to judge our on-going success or failure in the ongoing cultivation of the IoE DAO. This section will include “stretch goal” metrics that our community may use as a lens for measuring impact in furthering our mandates.
      5. Attack Resistance: a discussion of common attack vectors, including sock-puppet accounts, sybil attacks, and DoS attacks (among others). This section will include an unpacking of our mitigation strategies, with specific reference to admission fees, identity ceremonies, and reputation-weighted salaries.
      6. Legal: a discussion of the uncertain and global legal landscape when it comes to DAOs and tokens, with an analysis of legal modalities and wrappers. Importantly, this will cover member liability, taxation, and structure. This section will, aspirationally, include a recommendation for a specific legal wrapper, position, and approach to be pursued in initial formation of the IoE DAO.

   2. Static Rules: this section will unpack the initial constitutional processes for decision-making.

      1. Communication: this section will address informal and formal modes of conversation, as well as norms, challenges, and considerations for promoting open, active, thoughtful discussion toward decision-making and action. This will also include a comparison of various tools for facilitating communication.
      2. Proposals: a description of the proposal process, the variety and criteria constituting a legitimate proposal, revision considerations, best practices, and proposal tooling options.
      3. Deliberation: a description of the informal discussions, informal voting, formal voting, best practices, and deliberation tooling. Specific attention will be given to which proposals require higher or lower levels of auditability, velocity, quorum, etc.
      4. Implementation: a description of tools, policies, norms, and positions the IoE DAO will take when it comes to implementing DAO-voted decisions, on and off-chain.

   3. Dynamic Elements: this section will unpack unique, dynamic elements of the IoE DAO governance process, including reputation-based and skill-based staking.

4. **Operations & Strategy:**

   1. Spheres of Influence: a description and definition of the three core spheres of influence with which the IoE DAO will be concerned itself with.

      1. IoE Network: this will include a description of the core IoE protocols and primitives, with a focus on credential flows within the triangle of trust. This will also unpack the role of data stewards and processors, and the opportunities for individuals and organizations to join as IoE nodes. Additionally, this will include an overview of the way the IoE can make accessible graphs for visualizing and navigating the IoE as a whole.
      2. IoE Marketplace: this will include a description of the future goal of the IoE to record and compensate data labor in learn-to-earn models. The IoE DAO has a key role in governing the IoE marketplace to promote equity and ethical marketplaces, while preventing and mitigating attacks and bad actors.
      3. IoE dApps: this will include a description of dApps that the IoE will encourage and make possible. Specific attention will be given to how the IoE Network & IoE Marketplace, as infrastructure, create emergent properties for the creation of new and innovative applications, i.e. the Learner GPS.

   2. Ecosystem Value-Adds: a description of ways the IoE DAO provides concrete value—examples of deliverables with tangible impact across each mandate and sphere of influence. Each is a proposed avenue for the DAO to sustainably propagate value, but is ultimately up to the community to implement.

      1. Intellectual Property & Legal Wrapper: just as standards groups like IEEE and W3C provide spaces and platforms for open collaboration between organizations and individuals with strong intellectual property protections, the IoE could play a key role in the ecosystem: providing spaces for open collaboration in the IoE with IP protections.
      2. Technical Progress: the IoE DAO has the potential to play a key role in the consensus and development of the underlying IoE technologies, primitives, and protocols. For example, the IoE DAO can support establishing RPC interfaces for verifiable credentials, creating a coherent protocol interface that allows anyone in the IoE ecosystem to participate in the triangle of trust through sequences and procedures that abstract away implementation details in an interoperable, open format (as opposed to existing, vertical stack solutions). Other examples this section will discuss include supporting specific open source tooling (e.g. simplified ‘connect buttons’ for universal wallets), open source code reviews (e.g. merit-locked code reviews on PRs linked with automated DAO payments), and smart contract auditing support.
      3. Funding: a discussion on the role the IoE DAO can play in funding members, through traditional or non-traditional means, as they work to expand the IoE. Namely, the IoE DAO is perfectly positioned to provide processes for accelerating protocol implementations, network research, and dApps.
      4. Research: this section will describe the ways the IoE DAO can help coordinate and aggregate related research happening across thousands of organizations and experts around the world. Additionally, an analysis on why the IoE DAO is uniquely positioned to de-silo global research efforts in education and employment, and ultimately, the positive impact that will have on all stakeholders and ecosystem members.
      5. Simple Stakeholder SDKs & Tools: a detailed description of the SDKs and tools the IoE DAO provides to members, empowering each and every stakeholder to participate in the Internet of Education. This will include a description of the frameworks, tools, and resources for members to stand up their own localized ecosystems and implement each of the IoE utilities, including equity networks, learning wallets, skills registries, and launching their own associated governance subdao.
      6. Governance: one of the most obvious, but important, aspects of the IoE DAO is the intrinsic value of providing forums and space for legitimate governance of the IoE which places learners, employees, and stewards as the ultimate sovereigns and beneficiaries. This will include a discussion of future governance value to the ecosystem as the IoE Network stands up the data marketplace, and the ways the IoE DAO governance model can uniquely mitigate and prevent bad actors while upholding core values of decentralization.
      7. Developer Advocacy: a description of the ways the IoE DAO can lean on the community to champion and pioneer the vision of the IoE. This section will help to unpack the ways the IoE DAO, and its members, can evangelize IoE technology to motivate developers worldwide to join the community and co-create with us.
      8. Evolution: a closing discussion on the finite-nature of the propositions listed above, and how a key value-add to the ecosystem is a forum for deliberation of our core principles and ecosystem opportunities. This section will also analyze how communities often evolve chaotically, non-linearly, and according to unique, contextual, often unpredictable factors and needs.

   3. Security: conversation and checklists of the principles, considerations, and actions for our DAO to maintain the highest levels of security appropriate for our use cases in an on-going manner. Topics include multisig wallets and smart contract auditing requirements.,

   4. Finance: this section will provide an overview of the initial capitalization plans, on-going liquidity strategies, and other fiscal considerations (taxes, approved tokens, treasury implementations, etc.)

5. **Closing**: this section will synthesize the IoE DAO as a whole, and provide a clarion call for action, outlining the next key steps to launch, with details on how anyone, anywhere, can raise their hand to join the movement!
