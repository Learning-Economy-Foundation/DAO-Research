# Announcing: Internet of Education DAO Research + Tech
### Jan 7, 2022 • [Original Publication](https://www.learningeconomy.io/post/ioedaoresearch) • By Gabriel Sage

> The curtain rises on the future of education and employment. Lights, camera, decentralization.

With great enthusiasm, we would like to announce the next shift forward for the Learning Economy Foundation (LEF) and our goal to create more equitable and accessible education and employment for the world. LEF has been awarded 2 grants by the like-minded innovators of [DEVxDAO](http://www.devxdao.com/) to do a definitive applied study and taxonomy on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). The research will result in a detailed final report and playbook, a social research Hub, and an open source Internet of Education DAO framework that can be forked for use governing Internet of Education related decentralized projects and organizations.

With this research, LEF can delve into the fragmented and polarizing system of education and employment, where we will find new solutions to pioneer a global approach predicated on the inherent value of learning and skills. It is our belief that as learning and workplace data become increasingly incompatible and disconnected, opportunities are curtailed for individuals, resulting in stifled mobility and motivation. Moreover, the disparate nature of this critical data means solutions rooted in the current system are cloistered responses unable to breach the hurdles of flailing guesswork and legacy complications. But a solution is on the horizon.

Learning Economy Foundation is a U.S. based 501c3 non-profit committed to a new vision of education and employment—one in which data is not a source of friction, but one that equips learners and employees by establishing and recognizing the value in their work and skills. We call this idea the Internet of Education, and it is from this foundational belief that we can  protect individuals privacy and data sovereignty, while connecting the fragmented systems into a cohesive network of growth and impact. To galvanize change, imaginative solutions need to erode routine convention in large scale ways, and to deconstruct the concentrated bottlenecks of education and employment, we look to decentralization.

> DAO’s are a perfect solution to renovate the current education and employment systems and innervate them with transparency and accountability.

A decentralized structure allows for self-organization and governance that is stable and sustainable enough to securely address the protean education and employment landscape while placing agency into the hands of the individual. Without middlemen and wasteful hierarchies, an efficient and universal system can effloresce.  This mission for a learner centered Web3 education ecosystem is given new momentum by the grant awarded by DEVxDAO.

Under the aegis of DEVxDAOs steadfast and invigorating commitment to support and perpetuate a Web3-enabled world, our research to establish the Internet of Education takes shape. Our case study of applied research will analyze and identify key tenets of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), and through the lens of education and employment, find solutions to the big challenges of decentralizing education and employment based projects. Additionally, the grant will be used to create an open source software development kit that will allow widespread access for any organization, nation, or ecosystem wanting to launch a DAO through the IoE.

### WHAT'S NEXT?

Starting with our own genesis IoE DAO, we will begin making future Internet of Education infrastructure decisions built on the critical principle of democratic accessibility. With more than 1k organizations, advisors and reviewers, ranging from ministries and NGOs to private and public partners like World Bank, Lego, and UNESCO, the Internet of Education case study can begin evaluating and perpetuating a global revision of education and employment. A future in which everyone has equal and empowered access to learn and find satisfaction in their career is not an unreachable chimera. In fact, it has already begun. The stage is set, and the next act awaits.
